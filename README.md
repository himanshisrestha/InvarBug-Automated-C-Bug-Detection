## Bug Detection Insights

Based on the provided scopes, we can observe that functions A and B are frequently used together in `scope1`, `scope3`, and `scope5`. Function A is present in `scope1`, `scope2`, `scope3`, and `scope5`. Particularly, in `scope2`, function A is invoked without function B, which is atypical since A and B are usually called together. This discrepancy suggests a possible bug.

### Metrics for Bug Detection

- **Support**: Represents the frequency with which a pair of functions is called together.
- **Confidence**: The proportion of occurrences of a function pair relative to the total occurrences of one of the functions in the pair.

For example:
- **support({A,B})** is 3, indicating that A and B are called together 3 times.
- **confidence({A,B}, {A})** is computed as **support({A,B}) / support({A})**, which equals **3/4** or **75%**.

### Thresholds

- **Support Threshold (T_SUPPORT)**: The default value is 3.
- **Confidence Threshold (T_CONFIDENCE)**: The default value is 65%.

### Example Output

Given the default thresholds, the expected output might be:

- **bug: A in scope2, pair: (A, B), support: 3, confidence: 75.00%**
- **bug: A in scope3, pair: (A, D), support: 3, confidence: 75.00%**
- **bug: B in scope3, pair: (B, D), support: 4, confidence: 80.00%**
- **bug: D in scope2, pair: (B, D), support: 4, confidence: 80.00%**

### Types of Analysis

- **Intra-Procedural Analysis**: Focuses on analyzing within individual scopes without expanding into nested scopes.
- **Inter-Procedural Analysis**: Involves examining relationships between different scopes.

### Enhancing Detection

To improve bug detection, consider refining your approach with both intra-procedural and inter-procedural analysis techniques.

## Static Bug Detection Tools

Look into static analysis tools like Coverity for identifying and addressing bugs in projects, such as Apache Tomcat.
